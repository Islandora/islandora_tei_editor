The oldest people in the<placeName> village</placeName> will tell us fascinating stories of what they remember, which the younger members can write down, thus making a bridge between them and events which happened before they were born. After all, it is the history of humanity which is continually interesting to us, and your village his¬ tories will be the basis of accurate facts much valued by historians of the future. I am proud to think that you have called them "The Histories."</p>  </div>  <div n="d1e416" rend="894,2242,1304,2288">  <p n="d1e422">  <persName>  <forename>Susan</forename>  <surname>Tweedsmuir</surname>  </persName>.</p>  </div>  </div>
